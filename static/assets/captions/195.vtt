<v Speaker>MRS. COOPER</v> Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi, but it's just cut up fish sticks,

2
00:00:04.21 --> 00:00:07.00
<v Speaker>MRS. COOPER</v> and a side of Uncle Ben's.

3
00:00:07.02  --> 00:00:11.20 
<v Speaker>MRS. COOPER</v> They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters, but that doesn't make it sushi.

4
00:00:12.13 --> 00:00:17.00
<v Speaker>LEONARD</v> Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.

5
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:20.00
<v Speaker>MRS. COOPER</v> Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was "ching chong."

6
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:23.02
<v Speaker>LEONARD</v> Yeah, yeah, that too.

7
00:00:24.04 --> 00:00:27.19
<v Speaker>MRS. COOPER</v> So, Shelly, what's up with you and your friend Amy,

8
00:00:27.20 --> 00:00:29.13
<v Speaker>MRS. COOPER</v> if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?
